JXRangeTree
===========

Simple implementation of an [interval tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree) written in Objective-C++. Made for associating NSUInteger ranges (NSRange structs) with Objective-C objects. 

Heavily based on [PWIntervalTree](https://github.com/depth42/PWIntervalTree).
